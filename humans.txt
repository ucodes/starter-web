 Sometimes perception becomes people’s reality. That certainly feels like the case after last month’s deadly crash near Reagan National Airport, as every accident or close call seems to get magnified, raising questions about America’s airline safety.

The long-term and preliminary short-term statistics suggest that airline travel is about as safe as ever. But talk to any of your friends who are remotely afraid of flying, and I bet they will tell you that recent events have shaken them up.

Our fears often run ahead of reality. We’ve seen panics that really weren’t supported by data many times in the last half a century – in sometimes serious and sometimes humorous ways.
